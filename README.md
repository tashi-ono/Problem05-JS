Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, the largest number that divides them both without a remainder. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, and is often considered the first algorithm!

Algorithm:
If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop.  
If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop.  
Else GCD(B,A%B)

Example:
<br/>
A: 78   =>  A: 36           =>  A: 6            => Answer = 6 
<br/>
B: 36       B: 78%36 = 6        B: 36%6 = 0     =>
